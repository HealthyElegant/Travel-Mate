# Travel Mate Web App

This folder contains a simple Node.js/Express implementation of a web version of **Travel Mate**. It features an interactive onboarding quiz that captures a visitor's travel style, budget, party size and interests. The answers are used to generate basic travel recommendations.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js >= 14):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the quiz.

This is a minimal prototype meant to demonstrate the onboarding flow. You can expand the recommendation logic and connect it to a database or other APIs for richer personalization.
